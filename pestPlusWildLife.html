                       <span style="font-weight: bold;">Woodchucks,</span> also called groundhogs or whistle-pigs, come from the squirrel family. They are known for being the mascot of Groundhog Day, predicting whether there will be an early spring or longer winter being that they hibernate until warm weather permits play. Woodchucks, like squirrels are great climbers, but they also are very good swimmers which sets them apart from the common rodent.
