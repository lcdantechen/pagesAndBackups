                       <span style="font-weight: bold;">Woodchucks,</span> also called groundhogs or whistle-pigs, come from the squirrel family. They are known for being the mascot of Groundhog Day, predicting whether there will be an early spring or longer winter being that they hibernate until warm weather permits play. Woodchucks, like squirrels are great climbers, but they also are very good swimmers which sets them apart from the common rodent.

                       <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bats</span> have been regarded with superstition and fear in many cultures throughout history due to their nightly flying habits, strange appearance, and the tendency of certain species to feed on the blood of other animals. Over 1,200 species of bats exist in the world and less than five actually feed on blood. In fact, most bats are insectivores whose feeding habits are incredibly beneficial to humans. Bats are the only mammals who can truly fly. Large bat colonies can eat up to 500,000 pounds of insects each night. They hunt common pests, such as mosquitoes, flies, cockroaches, beetles, and moths, by using their large ears as radar dishes in a process known as echolocation.

                       <span style="font-weight: bold;">Opossums </span>are the main marsupial found in North America, where they live in urban settings, forests, and open fields. They are maybe best known for "playing dead," a barrier system used to seem less engaging to predators. Opossums are nighttime and omnivorous, exploiting any nourishment source they run over. Their eating routine comprises of bugs, little rodents, creatures of land and water, natural products, berries, waste, and pet food if left outdoors.

                 <h3>Bird Control And Bird Proofing Programs</h3> 
                <p>Birds are an important part of our natural environment in the area. As predators, they feed on insects, rodents, worms, fish and countless other animals. Game birds, song birds, hawks and other bird species contribute to outdoor recreation and the overall enjoyment of nature.</p>
                <p>
                       <span style="font-weight: bold;">Are Birds Protected by Law? </span>
                     </p>
                <p>
                  Because of these contributions, birds are afforded considerable protection by laws, regulations and public sentiment that controls what kind of bird control can be implemented. Public relations are an integral part of any bird proof and bird control project and Wildlife Management Services in the area will educate our clients and the public why a particular bird control or bird proof program or method is necessary.

                     </p>
                <p>
                       <span style="font-weight: bold;">The three birds </span>that most often become pests in the United States in urban areas are pigeons, starlings, and house sparrows. If you have ever tried to get rid of pigeons, you know just how difficult bird control and bird proofing can be.  Other birds, from hawks to swallows, may occasionally cause unexpected and unusual pest problems and require bird control. When blackbirds and crows roost in suburban areas they become pests and result in bird control or bird proofing. Woodpeckers may peck holes into house siding looking for insects, to make nest cavities and to communicate with other woodpeckers. Seagulls can feed on food-plants, and they roost and nest on large flat roofs with crushed stone.<br/>

Birds may be beneficial, neutral or harmful to man's interests, depending upon time, location and activity, and certain birds (sparrows, woodpeckers, waterfowl, pigeons and black birds) are more likely to become pests and require bird proofing and bird control. Pest bird situations that require bird control and bird proofing include:

                       <li>Feeding on agricultural products</li>
                       <li>Roosting or nesting around human habitations</li>
                       <li>Destroying vegetation and contaminating foods</li>
                       <li>Noise, droppings, odor and feathers</li>
                       <li>Diseases or ectoparasites affecting man including histoplasmosis and cryptococcosis</li>
                       <li>Unpleasant or hazardous working conditions</li>

                       <span style="font-weight: bold;">Skunks </span>are outstanding for their foul, impactful smell. Nationals from North America, South America, Indonesia, and different areas of the world where skunks are discovered know to avoid the creatures or hazard the anger of their specific safeguard system. Two of the most conspicuous North American species are the spotted and the striped skunk, while others, similar to the hoard nosed skunk, are less common.

                     <p>North American skunks typically have unmistakable highly contrasting markings and long-clawed paws utilized for burrowing. Striped skunks show two outward-bowing, thick stripes along their backs, which combine close to their tails, and white fixes on their heads. Spotted skunks have more differed and offbeat looking stripes joined by couple of genuine spots. Striped skunks weigh somewhere around 4 and 10 pounds. Spotted skunks are smaller as they measure close to 3 pounds.</p>

                     <h3>Seal Animal Entry Points & Cracks In Foundation Homes</h3>
                     <p>If you identify a chewed hole in a wall, a hole in attic, holes in soffits or cracks in foundation, it is important to first determine if the holes are animal related. YOU DO NOT WANT TO SEAL ANIMAL ENTRY POINTS IF THE ANIMALS ARE STILL INSIDE YOUR HOME. You can identify animal entry points by monitoring the areas with the holes and cracks for any animal activity, which may include squirrels, raccoons, birds, rodents and bats. If animals are the culprit, contact a Wildlife Management Services professional to assist with animal removal services. <br>

Remember, even if the holes are very small, this does not mean that animals cannot fit through them. Some animals can squeeze their bodies through holes as small as the size of a quarter!</p>

                      <h3>The Best Methods Of Sealing Animal Entry Points</h3>
                      <p>Animal entry points in your home may include holes chewed in the walls, cracks in the foundation of your home or holes in your attic and soffits. Repairing these entry points properly is imperative to prevent further animal access into your home. Wildlife Management Services can assist with home repairs that may include covering holes with chicken wire or other form of screen, filling foundation cracks, replacing siding or applying other cover solutions.</p>
                      <h3>Why It’s Important To Seal Holes & Cracks In Foundation In Your Home</h3>
                      <p>Sealing off holes within your home, or holes on the exterior of your home, is important in order to prevent animals from entering, getting comfortable and causing significant damage. Many animals seek shelter for nesting within homes; leaving cracks and holes in walls, attics and cracks in foundation is just inviting them in! If animals are entering your home through holes, cracks or gaps in the construction, they could be damaging insulation and electrical wires, leaving as mess of dangerous droppings, or keeping you up all hours of the night with the noises they make.<br>
